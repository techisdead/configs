## first install

The following lines install some basics then download this repo

```bash

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt install git

sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-0 libsecret-1-dev
cd /usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret
sudo make
git config --global credential.helper /usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/libsecret/git-credential-libsecret

```

This sets up github and also the libsecret library to store an encryped access token for github.  Thatâ€™s all, next time you try to commit or push you will have to get yourself a Github PAT (Settings -> Developer Settings -> PErsonal Access Token). Enter the PAT instead of your password. It will be automagically saved in your credential library and accessible in the future.

Set up git folders, e.g.

```bash

cd ~/
mkdir repos
cd repos
git clone https://github.com/techisdead/configs.git
cd configs

# You may want to run the following line by line...
#source firstinstall.sh 
```
